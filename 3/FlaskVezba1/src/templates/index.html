			<h2 id="section1">Universe</h2>

			<p>The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all
				other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, it is
				possible to measure the observable universe. The earliest scientific models of the universe were
				developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.
				Over centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the
				heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal
				gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and
				Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.</p>

			<h2 id="section2">Definition</h2>

			<p>The word universe may refer to a variety of concepts, which depend on the context. The physical universe
				of spacetime is typically defined in terms of matter and energy. The broadest definition states that the
				universe is composed of everything that exists. Consequently, the universe may be defined as the
				totality of existence, including planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all
				matter and energy. The observable universe is about 28 billion parsecs (91 billion light-years) in
				diameter at the present time. The size of the whole universe is not known and may be either finite or
				infinite. Observations and the development of physical theories have led to inferences about the
				composition and evolution of the universe.</p>

			<h2 id="section3">Etymology</h2>

			<p>The word universe derives from the Old French word univers, which in turn derives from the Latin word
				universum. The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the
				modern English word is used. The Latin word derives from the poetic contraction unvorsum — first used by
				Lucretius in Book IV (line 262) of his De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things) — which connects un,
				uni (the combining form of unus, or "one") with vorsum, versum (a noun made from the perfect passive
				participle of vertere, meaning "something rotated, rolled, changed").</p>

			<h2 id="section4">Chronology and Big Bang</h2>

			<p>The prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states
				that the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the universe
				subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying
				assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological
				constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that
				provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe. The Big Bang model
				accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the
				number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.</p>

			<h2 id="section5">Physical property</h2>

			<p>The physical properties of the universe, including size, shape, temperature, and composition, are
				described by current understanding in physics and cosmology. The total mass of the universe is estimated
				to be between 10^52 kg and 10^53 kg. The density of the universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it
				ranges from relatively high density in galaxies to very low density in voids. The universe contains a
				very large number of galaxies, which, in turn, contain a very large number of stars. The observable
				universe is about 28 billion parsecs (91 billion light-years) in diameter at the present time.</p>

			<h2 id="section6">Composition</h2>

			<p>The universe is composed almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter. Other
				contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated to constitute from 0.005% to close to 0.01% of the
				total mass-energy of the universe) and antimatter. The observable universe is isotropic on scales
				significantly larger than superclusters, meaning that the statistical properties of the universe are the
				same in all directions as observed from Earth.</p>

			<h2 id="section7">Habitability</h2>

			<p>The universe is the sum of all of its contents. It includes habitable planets, stars, galaxies, the
				contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The observable universe is about 28 billion
				parsecs (91 billion light-years) in diameter at the present time. The size of the whole universe is not
				known and may be either finite or infinite. Observations and the development of physical theories have
				led to inferences about the composition and evolution of the universe.</p>

			<h2 id="section8">Cosmological models</h2>

			<p>There are several competing theories about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything,
				preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that
				information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various
				multiverse hypotheses, in which the universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.</p>

			<h2 id="section9">Historical conceptions</h2>

			<p>Historically, the universe was first defined as "the cosmos" — the order of the universe, but it soon
				came to mean the totality of the physical universe. The term "cosmos" has also been used in a religious
				sense to describe the order of the universe. The concept of the universe as an ordered and structured
				system has been important in natural philosophy and religion and continues to be studied in philosophy
				and theology.</p>
